    "This notebook contains materials for scraping tweets from Twitter using snscrape's Python Wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Dependencies: </b> \n",
    "- Your <b>Python</b> version must be <b>3.8</b> or higher. The development version of snscrape will not work with Python 3.7 or lower. You can download the latest Python version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "- <b>Development version of snscrape</b>, uncomment the pip install line in the below cell to pip install in the notebook if you don't already have it.\n",
    "- <b>Pandas</b>, the dataframes allows easy manipulation and indexing of data, this is more of a preference but is what I follow in this notebook."
